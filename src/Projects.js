                <ProjectCells orientation="side" borderColor="#5D02E6" title="Haven" time="NOVEMBER 2021" image={haven} desc="Haven is an app to help people in need find resources. Haven connects these individuals to resources such as food pantries, homeless shelters, healthcare, phone hotlines, and more. This app was developed by me and three team members in 25 hours during a hackathon at Ohio State called HackOhio. The end result was an app with a simple, easy to follow UI, successful API requests, and the ability to check reviews of places, call hotlines, and see how close something is based on location information. Haven was coded in Kotlin, a first for me, and the result is incredible. Although the API key was deleted due to costs, the video showcasing the full experience can be seen at the repo's GitHub&#160;page." />
                <ProjectCells orientation="" borderColor="#AECB8F " title="First Portfolio" time="MAY-JUNE 2020" image={p1} desc="I used static HTML and coded this all from scratch, with minimal outside code. Through this I not only expanded my knowledge about the capabilities of JS, but I executed better programming practices and made this site responsive. Before this site, I had not really created anything with total responsiveness in mind. With this project, I tested out many different resolutions to make sure this looked acceptable on all. Additionally, I made sure that the design was consistent across both of the webpages. It features a minimalist design with colors that work well together. Although the site may look modest, it would not be the same site without the JS working under the hood. This makes viewing and interacting with this seemingly simple site a much more pleasant experience." />
                <ProjectCells orientation="side" borderColor="#64DEF2" title="Sound Selections" time="JULY 2020" image={sound} desc="For almost all of July 2020, I decided to create a Flutter app with a focus more on UI. Sound Selections tested my design skills and pushed me to create a full app without the need for a backend. The app displays songs I’ve been listening to and when selected, information about the song, such as a description and artists, is displayed. After completing this project, I was more confident in using Flutter and designing an app that can be as visually pleasing as it is&#160;functional." />
                <ProjectCells orientation="" borderColor="#00FFCD" title="WeCycle Landing" time="JANUARY 2020" image={wc} desc="I made the WeCycle landing page for a friend during the early months of 2020. Although it was not built for mobile and not going to be used, I took a bit of time out of my schedule during the school year to tinker with certain CSS animations dealing with SVGs. This project was based on an app idea my friends had built for fun, and I decided I would make a website (or at least experiment with one). The project itself was extremely difficult because I went in depth with images and animations, beyond what I had ever done before. It was used more as a learning experience than something I would present a product for, but I was very happy with the layout. What I learned from this difficult project was how to use SVGs, fonts, and general style elements. This is not mobile-friendly and some text does not show up on some browsers on Mac. I spent many hours coding this as well as using software to create SVG images, which was something I had never done extensively before, but every element of each image was created by&#160;me." />
                <ProjectCells orientation="side" borderColor="#9093C8" title="Dewit" time="MAY-JUNE 2020" image={dewit} desc="I began coding Dewit in the summer of 2020 with the goal of exposing myself to the Flutter and Dart languages. I didn’t know what to expect, as I had never coded anything aside from websites and programs for my software courses. In about two months of coding and teaching myself Flutter, I had an app that could be used as a to-do list. If I had more time, my friend and I would have made a backend part. The biggest challenge here was how little experience I had compared to anything I had done in the past two&#160;years." />
                <ProjectCells orientation="" borderColor="#B7C2E3" title="First Website" time="SUMMER 2018" image={fw} desc="This is my first website, created over the summer of 2018. It was the first time I had ever delved into the world of UI and web developing. I had no idea what to expect. I spent over 90 hours creating these web pages from scratch. I used very little JavaScript throughout the project, which came from outside sources. The code itself is messy and I left it how it looked when I finished; I unfortunately never got to cleaning it up, but I use it a bit for reference, so I leave the code just the way it was when I completed it. This is one of my favorite projects because, again, much of this was extremely new. When I began, I barely knew how classes worked, how to import fonts, or how to make any transitions. I'm proud of what I accomplished that summer and it's great to look back and see how much I grew. The biggest problem I faced besides my own inexperience was making sure everything looked nice on different-sized monitors. Although this is not mobile-friendly, I spent a great deal making sure computer screens were able to view the site as it should be&#160;viewed." />
