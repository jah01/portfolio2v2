# Joey's Summer 2021 Portfolio

Link: [GitHub Pages Link](https://jah01.github.io/portfolio2v2).

This is a site I created using React. I completed this project over the summer of 2021 and it is no longer being updated, aside from very necesary things, like React updates.

There is an introduction to who I am and what I do, where to find me, and a handful of coding projects I have completed.
